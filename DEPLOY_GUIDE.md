# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

Open your terminal and run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/kennethvillanueva/Desktop/airmax
git push origin main
```

### If you get an authentication error:

**Option A: Use Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Beat-The-Boss"
4. Check the "repo" scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token
7. When prompted for password, paste the token instead

**Option B: Use SSH**
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:DonDoodle12/Beat-The-Boss.git
git push origin main
```
